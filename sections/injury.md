## Injury

Running is hard and it hurts. There will be good days with good runs where everything clicks—where you are strong and nagging pains absent. 
here will also be many days where everything is against you: the weather, your body, your mind, and more.
On most days my mind is fully committed to the
ritual of running by my body rebels, and sometimes hard. At the beginning of 
each run body starts in a state of discomfort until it has settled into acceptance.
Usually by halftime all the body niggles have settled in line with my mind. 
For me, most discomfort I suppose stems from the sedentary IT work day, and most
of my niggles are digestive in nature. Never trust a fart after about mile 8.

In the span of the first after discovering distance running I ran nearly 1500
miles and suffered one significant injury, ITBS

I had two weeks with 70 miles per week.

It takes a significant amount of time for your bones, joints, muscles and
connective tissues to adapt to the new demand.  For me, I was not completely
pain free on my runs for the first year and a half. I would wake up sore, it
would take multiple days to recover but this did not matter. The hook was deep
set in.


Aside from the benefits of running comes the almost certainty and inevitability of injury and a significant challenge to avoid. Running has a very high incidence of injury. Take the method and mindset of this into other activities when injuries strike.

There are days where I have pain or random body discomfort. By the end of the run I'm almost always transformed into a better feeling self.
