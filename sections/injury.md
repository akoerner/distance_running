## Injury

Running is hard and it hurts. On most days my body starts in a state of 
discomfort until it has settled into acceptance.

There will be good days with good runs where everything clicks—where you are strong and nagging pains absent. There will also be many days where everything is against you: the weather, your body, your mind, and more.



Aside from the benefits of running comes the almost certainty and inevitability of injury and a significant challenge to avoid. Running has a very high incidence of injury. Take the method and mindset of this into other activities when injuries strike.

There are days where I have pain or random body discomfort. By the end of the run I'm almost always transformed into a better feeling self.
