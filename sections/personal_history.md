## Personal History
Physical activity as an important component to my life begin around the age of 
10. I was an awkward and overweight redhead that experienced extreme bullying. 
Around this time I was guided into the sport of collegiate wrestling. Wrestling
and, in turn, physical activity begin as tool that I leveraged to fit in. I lost 
weight, gained personal confidence, and was clearly able recognized the obvious 
and immediate benefits of physical activity; generally, my life was improved.
Transitioning into high school my motivations surrounding physical activity 
mutated from self-improvement centric to performance driven. I wanted to 
perform - in wresting - at all costs regardless of any deleterious effects. 
Workouts were always hard and at full torque motivated by wrestling. 
Then university hit. Wresting lost relevance, and the role of exercise in my 
life shifted from performance-enhancing tool to a tool used to negate or 
mitigate harmful behaviors such as heavy drinking, poor nutrition and other 
detrimental behaviors. This mitigation-centric mindset remained for over a 
decade. During this period, I also became aware of other positive effects, 
particularly the benefits for my mental health, that physical activity brought 
to my life. Over time, this gradually evolved into my principal motivation for 
physical activity, accompanied with a number of lingering negative carry-overs 
I previously established. 

Regarding carry-overs from my high school years, I believed that workouts had to
be intense, punishing, and at maximum effort otherwise I was wasting my time.
The gym was my primary outlet for this. Occasionally, I did go on runs, but 
they were hard, fast, and never exceeded more then 3 miles (~5 km).
Despite the importance and utility of intense workouts, complete story regarding
physical activity is far more intricate and complex as I have learned.

The current chapter of this story, that I want to tell in this article, began in
the early months of 2021, specifically in January and February, when the 
COVID-19 pandemic was trusted into the global consciousness. My reliable outlet,
the gym, became inaccessible, prompting me to search for alternative outlets for
physical activity and stress relief. While running was always familiar to me I 
had hangups with it. I held the belief that running was not for suited me;
it felt painful and unenjoyable and perceived it as boring. I thought I was too
physically large, and I thought my body type didn't align with that of a runner.
This erroneous belief could not have been farther from reality and the road to 
awakening and self-awareness is long and winding, as I am discovering.

The understanding and appreciation for running has been, for me, a slow and 
gradual burn that initially could have easily gone out. It took time and 
persistence to set in, and only due to the unique circumstances of the  pandemic 
which forced me into it did it fully take hold. Running, for me, begin as a 
marriage of necessity, due to the pandemic, and flourished into a spreading and 
deep fervent love, and a source of profound personal growth and discovery.

At the start of the pandemic, owing to unique personal circumstances, I was
situated on border of German and the Netherlands, with a channel running from my
town in Germany all the way to the north sea. The border of the Netherlands was
around 2.5 miles (4 km) distance from my residence with a straight, secluded and
direct pedestrian trail along the channel. These unique circumstances, as well 
as, the pandemic allowed distance running to take a foothold in my life. Do to
social isolation and gradually deteriorating mental health I begin to increase
time and distance that I ran along this path with a primary interest of people 
watching and experiencing more of the Netherlands. As an expat of both the
Netherlands and Germany, in many regards, both cultures hold a degree of
fascination, as well as, unfamiliarity to me. At the time I had never visited
the Netherlands and my only contact was my occasional runs stepping foot over 
the boarder only to return to Germany a few steps latter. The pandemic drove me 
to search out social contact vicariously thought this pedestrian path, which was
always bustling with activity from people of all ages when everything else was 
dead. This trail granted me a place of retreat beside the channel, where I 
encountered wetlands, wildlife, people, forests, and so much more.

I begin my runs on this trail with my usual habits pushing myself to run fast and
hard. I did not particularly enjoy it, however I did enjoy the human contact
along this path as I observed people and the novelty of running across an 
international border. I had a persistent curiosity of running deeper along the 
path into the Netherlands and exploring its offerings. 
Gradually, something within me began to shift, and a seismic change occurred at 
a distinct moment. Until that moment, I would
always rely on music to accompany my workouts. However, on that particular day, for a 
reason I can't quite recall, I switched off the music and started listening to 
an audiobook—'11/22/63' by Stephen King—and I was hooked. I started to get
pleasure out of my runs.  My runs started to become a source of pleasure for me
and I began to eagerly look forward to each session on the trail, fueled by a 
desire to discover my boundaries, engross myself deeper into the audio book,  
and see how just far I could go.

Discovering distance running has unveiled a potent meditative tool for me. It
has taught me the art of living in the present moment. I have come to embrace
that it is perfectly fine to allow your mind to become bored, which previously 
I was not comfortable with. Distance running has gifted me with heightened body awareness and mental 
presence fostering deeper connection to my own mind and body. These profound changes
resonated through all areas of my life. There is something unique and special
about practicing the ritual of an established and mechanical habit. 
Just going through the initial steps of putting on my running shoes noticeably reduces my stress level. 
From the moment I take my first step out the door, my mind begins to calm, and 
the meditative rhythm of each mile unfolds. 

In this article I want to present to you the lessons I have learned about
distance running and practical steps you could use to uncover and discover your
own personal love for distance running.
