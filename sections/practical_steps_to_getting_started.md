## Practical Steps to Getting Started Running

Running has a low barrier for entry, gradual but steep learning curve, and a 
high knowledge ceiling so you can grow into it to whatever depth is suitable to
you and your life.



Initially, running requires absolutely no investment in equipment. 

Depending on your fitness level 

- Establish a route
- Establish a consistent time
- Set a starting goal of 1 hour of activity.  You do not need to run the entire distance depending on fitness level. Start with walking for an hour three times per week.   


Anyone can participate in it at any age or fitness level.
