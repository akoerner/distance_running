## Airplane Mode
Some of the magic in distance running comes from the boredom. 

The activity and process of running shuts down ancillary thought and has
focusing effect for me. I feel like I have enhanced clarity and creativity.
I am better able focus, my thoughts are more stream-lined and do not jump around
so chaotically.

Allow you mind to be bored, allow it to wander.

Make yourself unsalable for a block of personal time. Do not look at your
screen, put your messages and notifications on do not disturb, disable your WIFI
and mobile internet.
