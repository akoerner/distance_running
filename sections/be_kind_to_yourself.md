## Be Kind To Yourself
My mantra is low and slow.  My runs should be calming for both my mind and body.
Run at your natural pace and do not try to over correct your bio mechanics or gate.
Run slower then you think you need to. Be physically and mentally kind to
yourself. The type of running I am talking about should be a peaceful experience
and not put you in a heightened mental state.

There are of course other types of running and at times they do appeal to me.
This is the beauty of the sport.
